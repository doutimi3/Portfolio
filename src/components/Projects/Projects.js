              an ExpressJS backend, a MongoDB database layer, and a ReactJS frontend. A user would interact with the ReactJS UI components at 
              the application frontend residing in the browser. This frontend is served by the application backend, which is on an Ubuntu server on AWS, 
              through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS. Each interaction that results in a data update request is routed to the NodeJS-based Express 
              server, which retrieves data from the MongoDB database as needed and provides it to the application's frontend, where it is shown to the 
              user."
